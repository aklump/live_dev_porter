It you do not land in the base path, check ~\/.bashrc and ~\/.bash_profile for the presence of a cd command in there.  You will need to comment that out or remove that line if you wish for LDP to land you in the basepath. ","tags":"","url":"remote.html"},{"title":"Processors","text":"  Database Processing  @todo  File Processing  For file groups having include filter(s), you may create processors, or small files, which can mutate the files comprised by that list.  A use case for this is removing the password from a database credential when the file containing it is pulled locally. This is important if you will be committing a scaffold version of this configuration file containing secrets. The processor might replace the real password with a token such as PASSWORD. This will make the file save for inclusion in source control.     Processors are not supported when using exclude rules in the file group definition.    To provide feedback to the user the processor should echo a string, which does not contain any line breaks. The file must exit with non-zero if it fails. When existing non-zero, a default failure message will always be displayed. If the processor echos a message, this default will appear after the response. If the file exists with a zero, there is no default message.   An example bash processor:  #!\/usr\/bin\/env bash  filepath=$1 short_path=$2  contents=$(cat \"$filepath\")  if ! [[ \"$contents\" ]]; then   echo \"$short_path was an empty file.\"   exit 1 fi echo \"Contents approved in $short_path\"   Same example in PHP:  &lt;?php $filepath = $argv[1]; $short_path = $argv[2];  $contents = file_get_contents($filepath);  if ('' == $contents) {   echo \"$short_path was an empty file.\";   exit(1); } echo \"Contents approved in $short_path\";  ","tags":"","url":"rm--processors.html"},{"title":"Databases","text":"  If a project uses at least one database, it must be defined in configuration for it to be included in the copy. You must give it an id at minimum. Once defined, it can be referenced later in the configuration. You may define multiple databases if necessary.  Sometimes you might define the same database with multiple ids, if you want to have different levels of export. For example you might have one that excludes many tables, and another that excludes none, that latter serving as a backup solution when you want more content than you would during normal development.  Often times when you are copying the content of a database, it is preferable to leave out the data from certains tables, such as in the case of cache tables. This is the reason for exclude_table_data. List one or more tables (astrix globbing allowed), whose structure only should be copied.  If you wish to omit entire tables--data plus structure--you will list those tables in exclude_tables.  The mysqldump_options allow you to customize the behavior of the CLI tool. ","tags":"","url":"rw--databases.html"},{"title":"Environment Roles","text":"  All public-facing websites have a server that acts as the production or live server. It can be said it plays the production role.  Most sites have a counterpart install, where development takes place; typically on the developer's laptop. This \"server\" is said to play the development role.  There may be a third installation where new features are reviewed before they are pushed to the live server. This can be the test or staging server, playing the selfsame role.  By these three examples, we have described what is meant by environment roles. When using Live Dev Porter, you must define at minimum one role and you may define an unlimited number of roles. The typical, as described above, would be two or three.  The flow of data between the environments is the next topic of discussion. Data, that is files not stored in source control and database content, should never flow into the live server. This is because the live server should always be seen as the single source of truth. Therefore it stands to reason that the production role should never be given write_access in our configuration.  Whereas data should be able to flow from the live server into either development or test. Therefore these environments are marked as having write_access. ","tags":"","url":"rw--environment_roles.html"},{"title":"Environments","text":"  The configuration of environments is where you define real-life server instances in the configuration files.  Every environment must tell it's role.  This item is where file_groups are mapped to actual directories in the environment.  Database connections are defined in the environment. ","tags":"","url":"rw--environments.html"},{"title":"File Groups","text":"  File groups are for handling files and directories which are not in source control. For example Drupal-based websites have the concept of a public directory for user uploads. It is for such case that this concept is designed.  Define as many file groups as you want, or none if appropriate. At minimum you must assign an id because this is what will be referenced to map the file group to actual file paths later in an environment definition.  There are two optional filters which can be used, include and exclude. Only one may be used, per file group. For syntax details see the rsync pattern rules. Here is an incomplete summary, covering the main points:   If the pattern starts with a \/ then the match is only valid in the top-level directory, otherwise the match is checked recursively in descendent directories. If the pattern ends with a \/ then it will only match a directory. Using * matches any characters stopping at a slash, whereas... Using ** matches any characters, including the slash.   If the include filter is used, for a file or folder to be copied it must be matched by an include rule. On the other hand, if the exclude filter is used then a file will not be copied if it matches an exclude rule.     If a local folder or file exists, yet it appears in a file group's exclude rules, it will never be removed by the pull command. You would have to manually remove it.      If a remote folder or file that was previously pulled gets deleted, it will be automatically be deleted from your local environment the next time you pull.
