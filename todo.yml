- ldp config test against DH servers hits a threshold and gets locked out, so need a way to reduce calls or throttle, or something like that.

  bug: init fails
  steps:
    - ./vendor/bin/ldp init
    - 'cp: /Users/aklump/Code/Projects/ChapterAndVerse/Numerica/site/app/vendor/aklump/live-dev-porter/init/processors is a directory (not copied).'

- ldp cc did not remove .live_dev_porter/.cache/test/databases/drupal/db.cnf; should createDefaultsFile always remove it? do we remove it on cc hook; we should.
